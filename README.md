# Credit-Card

This is a simple credit card payment form, with a responsive card to visualize information.

## Features

* Input information automatically fills in to the card.

* Card number detects whether the card is Visa, American Express, Master Card, or Discover.

* Once the card is detected, the other icons will be greyed out, except for the chosen card, and the card title will be changed to the card company.

* When CVC is input, the card will flip and display it on the back.

* If you are on the back, and edit any other detail, the card will flip back.

* Card design can be changed to whatever you want, along with signature.
